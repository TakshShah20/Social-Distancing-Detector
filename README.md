# Social-Distancing-Detector
This system provides an easy solution to detect distance between people and alert its users if the appropriate distance is not maintained. The system design has been developed on Tinkercad.com

## NOTE: The code along with circuit design images have been included in the report, which enlists all important details of this project.

# Scope:
Today, social distancing has become a norm in any social interaction we have due to the increasing threat of the spread of Covid-19. There are many innovations that have been created to help combat and reduce the spread of the deadly disease, not just with other types of devices but using the power of Arduino as well. This can be seen in other projects across the website such as a Hand wash timer or an automatic hand sanitizer dispenser.

This project aims to help reduce the potential spread of the disease by utilizing an ultrasonic distance sensor. The sensor measures the distance between itself and the object in front of it, whether it be an object or a person. If something comes within 1.5m of the sensor, a buzzer sounds, and an LED lights up, therefore signalling that someone or something is within the range of social distancing.

This Arduino device can be used in real-life situations. For example, if you're in a queue at a coffee shop or at a train station. I have included a hyperlink for a simple 3D rendering of the proposed housing via TinkerCad. With the housing, you could clip this product on your belt or just hold it.
Overall, as individuals, we need to start adapting social distancing more and this is exactly what this device promotes through its visual and audio aids via the buzzer and LED.
